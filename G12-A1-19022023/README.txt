This folder should contain the questions for assignment 1. Questions are labeled as is across files/folders except for No. 4, which is
listed as client/server java files. A file labeled "group members" contains the names and pirate ID's of the members within this
group.

To compile and run questions 2, 3, and 5, run the command "clang qX.c -o qX", with X being the respective question number. 
Once that command is run, run the command "./qX" to run the program for the question.

In order to compile question number 4 please upload the client and server java files into a respective IDE that can compile java.
Eclipse was used to build and run these programs. First run the server program to begin listening to for a request from the client.
Next, run the client program to find and establish a connection between the two and then ask the user for a message input.
After message is input and sent, the server should echo the input message.
